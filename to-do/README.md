## Description
This is a simple todo app, where the user can type in a new task and delete or "cross off" tasks by pressing a button. When all tasks are gone, a Bootstrap alert pops up to say "All Done for Now!"

## How to Run
Type tasks in the input area and press enter to create a new task. Remove exisiting tasks by clicking the button.
